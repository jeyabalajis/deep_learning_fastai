The most widely practical application of NLP is classification, i.e. classifying a document automatically into some category.
Examples:  
- Sentiment analysis (e.g are people saying *positive* or *negative* things about your product)
- Author identification (what author most likely wrote some document)
- Legal discovery (which documents are in scope for a trial)
- Organizing documents by topic
- Triaging inbound emails

### Stochastic Gradient Algorithm (SGD)

> SGD, or stochastic gradient descent, is an optimization algorithm. Specifically, SGD is an algorithm that will update the parameters of a model in order to minimize a given loss function that was evaluated on the predictions and target. The key idea behind SGD (and many optimization algorithms, for that matter) is that the gradient of the loss function provides an indication of how that loss function changes in the parameter space, which we can use to determine how best to update the parameters in order to minimize the loss function. This is what SGD does.
